# SA_challenge
Initial repo to store versions and improvements over time.

Struggling a bit to get the essence of a challenge. 
In task one it's defined "â€¢ Design high-level view diagrams of the current business domain model"
Which would be fine if a bit more background info has been provided. 
Currently process is defined as "The current way of working is quite manual, basically phone calls and notebooks, which leads to a lot of delivery issues and delays."

To be reviewed once again in the morning after the first coffee.
