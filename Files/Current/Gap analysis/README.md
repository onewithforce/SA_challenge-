Making a GAP analysis based on the few sentences is a bit tricky, as we don't know the importance of the component to the business.
Usually end user experience is very important, but in our case we don't know if we are backfilling store warehouse or delivering already bought items by consumers.

There is no information if the Shipping process required optimization, like a single truck per store or filling max capacity per truck and requesting another one.
There are prons and cons for different scenarios, but let's give it a try with the provided information.
Few more points could be added, but shall wrap up and make a final commit and provide the files.

Exported the original ods (Libre suite) to a Excel format as well, hopefully no issues with opening it on a different platform.
